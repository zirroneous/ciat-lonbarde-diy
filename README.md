 adventures with the paper circuit sdiy designs of **peter blasser**, aka **ciat-lonbarde**.

 inspired in no small part by the work of **crucfx, pugix, and tripping on wires**.


## the panels

are meant to fit into this line of 6 inch wide desk organizer boxes:

they're nice skiff size, with plenty of wiggle room inside at 2 inch tall.

## the files

are done in illustrator, and separated by layers. meaning, if you want to reproduce this work, all the vector data is there. once each design is verified, i'll export an **.svg** with only the panel border and hole placement.

### caveats

i've taken liberties in interpreting some of these circuits. some concepts aren't practical, probably, and some require mods to the original circuit. i'll be fleshing out the info as i go, but for now, consider me another skeleton on the road to understanding the strange and beautiful synth-building work of peter blasser.

mostly the hole sizes are a good fit for commonly available parts. some of them aren't tho. i'm chasing those down and fixing them as i go. the good news is none of the holes are too large for their intended fit.

crows remember your face, generationally.
