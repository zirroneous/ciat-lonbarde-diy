# rollz 5
 rollz 5 - a kind of organic pulse-brain experimental "drum machine."
 
 concerns the design by peter blasser here:
 http://ciat-lonbarde.net/ciat-lonbarde/rollz5/index.html
 
 original paper circuit build documents are included in this repo (folder "pb - rollz5 papers",) 
 as are the corrected gerbs published by "tripping on wires":

 rollz 5 panel (by molg 2022):
 
 intended to fit into a 6x15" desk organizer, like this one:

 (you may need to slightly alter the perimeter dimensions for fit.)
 
 roll 5 companion concept panel (by molg 2022): 
 
 a sidekick box for the main rollz. designed for the 6x9" box of the same product line linked above.
 the idea: 
  - 1 cv-roolz 5-6 circuit (available as a pcb by crucfx, his paper circuit included in this repo.)
  - 1 of each 3, 4, and 5 rollz circuit to complete the pulse-brain "cluster"
  - 4 experimental avdog vca's (by pugix, schematic included here. available as a quad vca pcb from crucfx.)
